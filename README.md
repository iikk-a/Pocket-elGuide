Pocket elGuide 2.1.1 initial commit

This application has been released on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iikkag.gigantti_toolbox

It is not useful for anyone other than Gigantti, Elgiganten and Elkjop employees. 

Please do not take any code from this repository, you can find better code elsewhere. This code has been strapped together in just about under 3 days so it most likely has bad coding practices and bad ways to do certain things. It also contains a bunch of useless and zombie code, but I haven't gotten around to removing it all. It has more than one class that is incomplete and unused, but if I ever get around to fixing this, I will make it a lot better.

So if you take any code from this, please make sure you thoroughly test it beforehand, so it doesn't contain any bugs or bad practices that are going to hinder you later.

If you have any questions or suggestions, you can send them to me at iikka.grondahl@gmail.com. Please do title it "Pocket elGuide Github" if you do, so I am more likely to see it. Thank you.
