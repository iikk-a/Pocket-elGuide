# Pocket-elGuide
Pocket elGuide 2.1.1 initial commit

This application has been released on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iikkag.gigantti_toolbox

It is not useful for anyone other than Gigantti employees. 

Some of the code here has been done in under three days, but I have now mostly fixed all of it and deleted the code I don't use. It SHOULD be a lot better. Keep in mind, the refactoring and rewriting was done in one evening, so it most likely still has bad practices and bad code, but hopefully I got rid of most of it.

The application was now updated to accommodate smaller screens as well. The latest patch should make it a completely viable application. Cannot 100% guarantee it works, since I am only a small dev with limited testing time and time to rewrite code.

And I am also quitting from Gigantti soon, so my motivation to complete this project is fading.

So if you take any code from this, please make sure you thoroughly test it beforehand, so it doesn't contain any bugs or bad practices that are going to hinder you later.

If you have any questions or suggestions, you can send them to me at iikka.grondahl@gmail.com. Please do title it "Pocket elGuide Github" if you do, so I am more likely to see it. Thank you.
